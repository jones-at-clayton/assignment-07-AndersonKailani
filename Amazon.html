    <h1>Donating To The Amazon Rain Forrest</h1>
        <p>The Amazon produces about 6 percent of the oxygen currently being made by
            photosynthetic organisms alive on the planet today. That's why it's important that we as Earth's
        inhibitors help it's restoration. While not every person can physically be there to help this portion of mother nature out,
            we can each do our part to help by spreading awareness and donating money.</p></main>
